Algorithm to Find an Absolute Permutation:

If k is zero:

Return the list [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

Check if permutation is possible:

If 
n
n is not divisible by 
2
×
k
2×k:

Return [-1] (impossible to build permutation).

Build the permutation:

Initialize an empty list res.

Set a flag add to true.

For each position i from 1 to n:

If add is true, append i + k to res.

If add is false, append i - k to res.

Every time i is a multiple of k (i.e., i % k == 0):

Flip the add flag (true becomes false, false becomes true).

After the loop, return the list res.

Explanation:

For k = 0, the permutation is simply the identity [1, 2, ..., n].

If n cannot be divided into blocks of size 2k, no valid absolute permutation exists.

For valid cases, the numbers alternate between adding and subtracting k in blocks of size k.
