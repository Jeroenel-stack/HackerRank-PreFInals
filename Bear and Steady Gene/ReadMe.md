Algorithm to Calculate Gene Imbalance:

Initialize a count map for each base ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'):

Set count of each base to 0.

Count occurrences of each base in the input string:

For each character in gene, increment the respective count (A, C, G, or T).

Find the maximum count among all bases.

Compute the adjustment value:

Multiply the maximum count by 2, then subtract the length of gene.

Return the result.

Summary:

The algorithm tallies the frequency of each nucleotide in the gene string.

It finds how far the largest base is out of balance and provides a formula to measure or correct this imbalance.
