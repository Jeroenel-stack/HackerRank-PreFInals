Precompute max arm length for each cell:

For each cell (i, j) in the grid:
If cell is 'G', expand in all four directions as far as possible while staying within bounds and on 'G' cells.
Store the maximum arm length (cells[i][j] = k - 1).
List all possible pluses:

For each cell (i, j) and each possible arm length from 0 to cells[i][j], create a plus object {i, j, arm, area} where area = arm * 4 + 1.
Check overlap between two pluses:

For each plus, generate all its occupied cells (center and arms).
For a pair of pluses, check if any cell overlaps.
Try all pairs of pluses:

For every pair of pluses, if they do not overlap, calculate the product of their areas.
Track the maximum such product.
Return the maximum product found.
