Count ways to build a single row (F[j]):

For each length j from 1 to m, sum ways to build using blocks of size 1, 2, 3, or 4.
F[j] = F[j-1] + F[j-2] + F[j-3] + F[j-4] (if indices are valid).
Count ways to build the wall ignoring cracks (G[j]):

For each length j, raise F[j] to the power of n (number of rows).
G[j] = F[j]^n (modulo MOD).
Use inclusion-exclusion to count stable walls (S[j]):

For each length j, subtract unstable configurations:
For each possible split k (from 1 to j-1), subtract S[k] * G[j-k].
S[j] = G[j] - sum_{k=1}^{j-1} S[k] * G[j-k] (modulo MOD).
Return the number of stable walls of width m (S[m]).
