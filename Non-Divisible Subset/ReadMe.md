Initialize an array remainders of size k to count the frequency of each remainder when elements of the input set S are divided by k.

Traverse the array S, and for each element calculate the remainder when divided by k. Increment the count of that remainder in remainders.

Initialize the result count as the minimum of either the count of elements with remainder 0 or 1, since only one element with remainder 0 can be included to avoid pairs summing to a multiple of k.

For each remainder i from 1 up to k/2 (inclusive), add to the result the maximum count between elements with remainder i and remainder k-i. This step ensures that pairs formed by numbers whose remainders sum to k do not both appear in the subset.

If k is even, there can be only one element with remainder k/2, so add 1 to the result if such elements exist.

Return the result as the size of the largest subset meeting the criteria of having no pair sums divisible by k.
