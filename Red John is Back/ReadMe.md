Count ways to fill a wall of size n:

Use dynamic programming (dp array).
For each position i from 1 to n:
You can add a vertical brick (dp[i] += dp[i-1]).
If i >= 4, you can add a horizontal brick of length 4 (dp[i] += dp[i-4]).
dp[n] gives the total number of ways to fill the wall.
Count the number of primes less than or equal to dp[n]:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark non-prime numbers up to dp[n].
Count the number of primes in this range.
Return the count of primes.

Summary:
First, compute the number of ways to fill the wall using DP.
Then, count how many primes are less than or equal to that number using the sieve.
Return the prime count.
