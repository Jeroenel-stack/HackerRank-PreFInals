Initialize a counter and a dictionary.

count for the number of anagram pairs.
anagramDict to store counts of sorted substrings.
For each possible substring length (from 1 to s.length):

For each starting index, extract the substring of that length.
Sort the substring's characters to get its canonical form.
For each sorted substring:

If it has been seen before, increment count by the number of times it has appeared (since each previous occurrence forms a new anagram pair).
Update the dictionary to reflect the new occurrence.
Return the total count of anagram pairs.

Summary:
Count all pairs of substrings that are anagrams by grouping substrings with the same sorted character sequence and counting how many pairs can be formed.
