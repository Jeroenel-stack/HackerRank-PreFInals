Initialize two variables:

low: Maximum cost if previous element is set to 1.
high: Maximum cost if previous element is set to B[i-1].
Iterate through the array from the second element:

For each position i:
low2: If current is set to 1, take the max of:
Previous low (both previous and current are 1, cost 0).
Previous high plus cost of changing from B[i-1] to 1 (abs(1 - B[i-1])).
high2: If current is set to B[i], take the max of:
Previous low plus cost of changing from 1 to B[i] (abs(B[i] - 1)).
Previous high plus cost of changing from B[i-1] to B[i] (abs(B[i] - B[i-1])).
Update low and high.
Return the maximum of low and high after processing all elements.

Summary:
Use dynamic programming to track the best cost for each position if you set the value to 1 or to its original value, updating at each step.
Return the highest possible cost.
